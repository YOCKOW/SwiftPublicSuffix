# SwiftPublicSuffix

`SwiftPublicSuffix` provides Swift code converted from [PUBLIC SUFFIX LIST](https://publicsuffix.org/list/).
It was originally written as a part of [SwiftCGIResponder](https://github.com/YOCKOW/SwiftCGIResponder).  
It is not intended to use this library directly in each project. You can use [SwiftNetworkGear](https://github.com/YOCKOW/SwiftNetworkGear) instead.
